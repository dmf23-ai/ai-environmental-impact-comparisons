# Handoff

Entry point for a fresh chat picking up the AI Environmental Impact Comparisons project. Read this first, then the docs linked below.

## What this project is

A static website that puts AI's water and energy footprint next to other large uses people already understand — driving, gaming, golf courses, lawns, streaming, Bitcoin, EV charging, residential AC. The site is meant to give arguments about AI's environmental impact a shared, sourced starting point. David is building it as a personal side project so he can point people at it during conversations.

- **Live site:** https://ai-environmental-impact-comparisons.vercel.app/
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/dmf23-ai/ai-environmental-impact-comparisons
- **Local directory:** `C:\Users\dmf23\Documents\Claude\Projects\AI Environmental Impact Comparisons`

## Tech stack

- Astro 5.x static site (no Tailwind; plain CSS with tokens in `src/styles/global.css`)
- Web fonts via Fontsource: Inter Variable (body) + Source Serif 4 Variable (headings)
- Hosted on Vercel via auto-deploy from the GitHub `main` branch
- DNS through David's Cloudflare account; no custom domain assigned yet
- David is on Windows, uses PowerShell, has GitHub CLI installed

## Where we are

All editorial content is in place. Phases 1–6 closed.

- **Phases 1–4.** Astro scaffold, GitHub + Vercel deploy, design tokens locked, web fonts, masthead, hourly hero on the home page, all 14 comparison cards live on `/comparisons`.

- **Phase 5 (closed 2026-05-07).** All eight home-page infographics live below the hourly hero, in render order:
  1. `InfographicRangeVsPoint.astro` — "Why every figure here is a range." Pedagogical primer. Single dot + striped band on a shared linear x-axis.
  2. `InfographicAnnualTwh.astro` — "How big is AI, really?" Six-bar snapshot.
  3. `InfographicWaterBracket.astro` — "Are AI data centers thirstier than golf courses?" Six-bar snapshot.
  4. `InfographicDcTrajectory.astro` — "Data-center electricity, 2017 to 2030." Time-axis chart, historical line + projection band 830–1,350 TWh by 2030.
  5. `InfographicAiShareTrajectory.astro` — "AI's slice of data-center electricity." Sister chart, 2024→2030.
  6. `InfographicHouseholdEquivalents.astro` — "Data-center electricity, in household-years." Unit-conversion bar chart with horizontal ACTUAL/PROJECTED hairline.
  7. `InfographicWattScalePrimer.astro` — "What a TWh actually is." Scale ladder primer; five log-spaced rungs (1 kWh → 1,000 TWh) with the site's three anchor figures plotted on the same log axis.
  8. `InfographicTrainingVsInference.astro` — "Where the carbon actually goes." Single-panel log axis (0.1 → 100M tCO₂); five training-event dots vs. one annual-inference range bar.

  Originally planned 8–10 visuals; the project pivoted to Phase 6 at six, returned 2026-05-07 to ship the final two. The plan's two unbuilt items (visual #5 "Where it lands" map, visual #10 "myths" graphic) are not in scope for v1.

- **Phase 6 (closed 2026-05-06).** `/methods` complete: 23 sections in render order — hourly hero, eight home-page infographics, 14 comparison cards. Each display on the rest of the site carries a "How this was calculated →" link to its matching section.

- **IEA April 2026 audit (closed 2026-05-03).** All site figures reconciled to the IEA April 2026 update — electricity 415→460 TWh in 8 places, CO₂ 220→180 Mt in 5 places, prose recomputed where the math changed, `last_verified` bumped on the affected sections.

**Next: Phase 7** — verifier script and weekly GitHub Action per `website_plan.md` Section 7. The natural first move is a source inventory: for each tracked URL in `figures.json`, classify as stable structured page (parseable HTML/JSON), PDF (needs `pdf-parse`), or paywalled/unparseable. That classification shapes the script's structure and the per-source error handling.

Design refinement (both overall and per-component) is being saved for after Phase 7 ships, so the critique can be a single holistic pass once all structural work is in place.

## Read these in order

1. `website_plan.md` — full plan: editorial frame, audience, structure, comparison set, infographics, defensibility mechanisms, update mechanism, tech stack rationale, phased build, queued items. **Section 7 is the spec for Phase 7.**
2. `authorial_voice.md` — David's voice description. Use as a guideline. The anti-AI-speak rubric in Claude's persistent memory takes precedence when they conflict.
3. `user_profile.md` — collaboration preferences: compact responses, beginner coder, small verifiable milestones, focus on one thing at a time, distinguish facts from hypotheses.
4. `phase1_setup.md` — original Phase 1 walkthrough; mostly historical now.

The anti-AI-speak rubric memory file (in Claude's persistent memory) governs all prose for this project — site copy, chat replies, code comments. Apply it before publishing anything.

## Schema decisions

`figures.json` has six distinct schema shapes for infographics, each tied to a specific visual type. New one-off didactic visuals get their own shape; consolidate when a third visual of the same type appears.

1. **Bar-chart shape** (`figures` array) — `annual-twh`, `water-bracket`
2. **Trajectory shape** (`historicals` + `projection`) — `dc-trajectory`, `ai-share-trajectory`
3. **Unit-conversion shape** (`twh` / `mwh_per_household` / `boundary_after_index`) — `household-equivalents`
4. **Single-figure didactic shape** (`demo_figure` + `caption`) — `range-vs-point-primer`
5. **Rung-ladder shape** (`rungs` + `site_anchors` + `axis_min_twh` / `axis_max_twh`) — `watt-scale-primer`
6. **Training/inference shape** (`training_events` array + `inference` range + `x_min_tco2` / `x_max_tco2`) — `training-vs-inference`

Other architectural decisions worth knowing:

- **`niceCeiling` consolidated to `src/lib/niceCeiling.ts`** with a parameterized `granular: true` opt-in for tighter mantissa steps (used by water-bracket; default by other bar charts). Now duplicated across three bar-chart components plus the original coarse version in `RangeBar.astro`. Consolidation queued for next bar-chart visual or design pass.
- **Editorial captions baked into the SVG** for didactic visuals (range-vs-point, watt-scale, training-vs-inference): a one-line italic Source Serif sentence sits between the axis and the footer rule so a saved image carries the rule.
- **Each infographic is a single self-contained `<svg>`** with kicker, title, plot, axis, source attribution, and last-verified stamp baked inside. Surrounding HTML carries only the prose summary and the clickable `SourceLine`. Honors the plan's "right-click-save produces something useful" promise.
- **Components named `Infographic*.astro`,** dropped into `index.astro` in priority order below the hourly hero. A `/figures` gallery is deferred — reassess in the design pass.
- **Reference bars** (e.g., U.S. residential in annual-twh and household-equivalents) use accent color at 0.32 opacity to read as scaffolding. Triggered by `role: "reference"`.
- **`SourceLine.astro`** accepts an optional `methodsAnchor` prop; consumers opt in to render the "How this was calculated →" link.
- **Anchor convention for /methods:** comparison cards reuse their `anchor` field (so `/methods#water-vs-golf` matches `/comparisons#water-vs-golf`). Hourly hero is `hourly-hero`. Infographics use their `figures.json` `id` value (e.g., `range-vs-point-primer`, `dc-trajectory`, `training-vs-inference`).
- **Visual #7 (training-vs-inference) departed from the plan's "two-panel time-axis" framing.** Went with single-panel log-axis snapshot because per-year inference figures pre-2024 are too speculative to anchor honestly. Methodology section walks the editorial rationale.
- **Trajectory geometry duplicated across two trajectory components.** Acceptable per the same logic — refactor at three.

## Open questions for David

Queued for the post-Phase-7 design pass:

- **Inference bar width on visual #7 (training-vs-inference).** The 8.4–27.2 MtCO₂ range is only ~29 px wide on the log axis. Editorially correct but might read as visually underwhelming. Options: thicker bar height, explicit "× 1,300" annotation arrow from Llama 3 to the bar, higher-contrast stripe pattern.
- **Decade tick label style on visual #7.** Compact "1k / 1M / 100M" notation; could swap to expanded "1,000 / 1,000,000 / 100,000,000" if preferred.
- **Mobile readability of visuals #7 and #8.** Wide log axes haven't been verified at narrow viewport widths.
- **Rung-0 / rung-1 spacing on visual #8 (watt-scale primer).** "a microwave for an hour" left-anchored at chart edge has a small theoretical overlap with rung 1 at conservative width estimates. Verify on render.
- **Right-edge touching on infographic bars.** When the highest bar's value equals the chart's `niceCeiling`, the bar runs flush against the axis right edge (queued since Phase 4).
- **Trajectory band fill opacity (0.16).** May be too pale at typical viewing distance.
- **Historical line jumpiness from irregular anchor years** (2017, 2018, 2022, 2024, 2025) on the DC trajectory.
- **U.S./global pair affordance.** The water bracket pairs U.S. and global figures by label parallelism alone.
- **Two virtue-claim patterns in `website_plan.md` Section 1 prose** ("honest ranges" and "calibrate, not to comfort or alarm" on line 9) flagged but not scrubbed. Planning-doc prose, not site copy.
- **Home-page scroll length.** Eight infographics below the hourly hero is approaching long. `/figures` gallery placement reassessment is part of the design pass.

Other open items:

- **Domain name.** Some directions in `website_plan.md` Section 10. Not yet picked.
- **Global golf source.** The water bracket and water-vs-golf comparison currently use a derived "site estimate" range (800–1,500 Bgal) for global golf. Decision: ship with explicit "site estimate" framing; replace if/when a primary source surfaces.

## Working notes

The persistent memory files cover most of these; pointers below for context.

- **Edit/Write tool truncation.** Edit and Write can silently truncate file tails on `.json`, `.astro`, and `.md` files at sizes from 1.5K up. The tool reports success and the Read tool may show full content, but the on-disk file (visible via the bash mount) is missing its tail. Reliable workaround: bash Python heredoc for `figures.json`; `cat > path << 'EOF' ... EOF` for plain text; verify every change with `wc -lc` and `tail` on the bash mount. Captured in `feedback_edit_tool_truncation.md`.
- **Cowork system-reminder file-dump tax.** Each component edit triggers a system-reminder that re-dumps the full file contents into context (250+ lines, ~2–3K tokens). Account for this when judging fresh-chat timing. Captured in `feedback_cowork_dump_tax.md`.
- **Never run git from the sandbox bash.** Even read-only commands create a stale `.git/index.lock` that blocks David's local git. All git operations run in David's local terminal.
- **Sandbox `npm install` for Astro times out at 45 seconds**, so full builds aren't reliably verifiable in the sandbox. David's local machine handles them fine.
- **PowerShell pager handling.** When giving David CLI instructions, prefer `git --no-pager` to avoid the pager trap on multi-line paste-in blocks. Captured in `feedback_powershell_pager.md`.
- **Draft-then-write workflow.** For prose-heavy file additions, draft prose in chat first, then commit all file work in one atomic Python heredoc rewrite after sign-off. Captured in `feedback_draft_then_write.md`. Reinforced through visuals #7 and #8.
- **methods.astro is 2,058 lines / 88.6K** after Phase 5 wrap. Modify via Python heredoc with sentinel-string anchored replaces; the post-edit dump tax does not fire when the file is modified through the bash mount rather than via Edit/Write.
- **Geometry simulation before SVG coding.** For log-scale charts with tight label/dot positioning, simulate positions in Python first to catch overlap issues. Caught a wrap-overlap problem on the watt-scale primer's rung references before write; confirmed clean dot positions on training-vs-inference.
